# audio-jump
simple jumping game that uses audio to jump

I mainly wanted to make this because I wanted to test a python audio library. I decided it would be fun to make a simple game using it.

I might update in the future. frequency controlling jump heigths, expanding gameplay and fixing scuffed code.

! I RECOMMEND NOT LOOKING AT THE CODE !
